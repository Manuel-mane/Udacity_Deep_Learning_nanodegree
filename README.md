# Udacity Deep Learning nanodegree (PyTorch)

This repository contains projects which are part of the Udacity Deep Learning nanodegree program.

### Completed projects

* `Predicting Bike-Sharing Patterns`: Implement a neural network in NumPy to predict bike rentals.
* `Dog Breed Classifier`: Build a convolutional neural network with PyTorch to classify any image (even an image of a face) as a specific dog breed.
* `TV Script Generation`: Train a recurrent neural network to generate scripts in the style of dialogue from Seinfeld.
* `Face Generation`: Use a DCGAN on the CelebA dataset to generate images of new and realistic human faces.
